# list of all bookmarklets

### a list of all the current bookmarklets and what they will do.

* all bookmarks.js
this is a hub for all of the bookmarklets in the repository. it is the thing executed when you run the main bookmarklet.
* 3d page
this will make the page you are currently on have a cool 3d effect. pazza082234 is thinking about a extension and this will be a checkbox on the extension.
* DOMII
A cool game you can play in your browser on top of the website. press space and a spaceship will destroy whatever is Infront of it. press W to move forward, A, and D to turn, and S dose nothing :(
* archive search
lets you search the internet archive with ease with a simple bookmarklet.
* auto clicker
clicks automatically for lazy people or people that want a lot of cookies on cookie clicker.
* better ctrl f
this bookmark takes normal gorse ctrl f (a built in search tool on chrome plus its derivatives and Firefox) and lets you search for more then one thing without losing the spot of the last thing.
* cashed sites
google has this thing with stealing data if you don't know. and google makes copies of all websites and calls it cashed sites. they do this to improve load times. but unfortunately (for you school) this includes most of the website, thus unblocking it.
* classroom disguise
this may be replaced soon with a better one (planed). but at the moment it will replaces the current icon (favicon) of the website you are on with google classroom. in the new one you can chose between google, google classroom, and canvas (google classroom but better)
* clear cookies
makes the cookie monster sad and removes all the cookies that the website you are on has made.
* dark mode
dark reader if your school blocked all extensions. makes everything dark.
* edit site
this will let you modify the website you are on to what ever you want. this will only apply to you and will go away after reload. so no [insert friend name here] you did not just delete google.
* exec code
in other words, execute code from a note pad thing that will appear in the corner of your screen.
* inject script
this will inject a script. and it will show the box that re appears, with the original text still there. this is useful if you want to run code, modify code, run it another time without pressing ctrl c and v a infinite amount of times.
* inspect elament (broken)
it lets you inspect a element. useful if your school distract blocked inspect element.
* notepad
small little notepad that can rest in the bottom right of your screen. good if you need to make notes quickly, and are on a Chromebook without a text editor.
* password generator
this will generate you a password with the questions it asks you. the password is completely random.
* piano
will summon a little piano, it is cool and awesome for annoying friends with your "good" piano skills.
* pervent tab from closing
this will give you a warning before you close a tab. so when you are mass closing your tabs for the day you don't lose any progress.
* snow in chrome
make it snow with a cook effect on your tabs to impress your friends.
* unblocker1
works most of the time for unblocking lite websites. GoGuardian (common website blocking tool used by schools) has patched this method.
* unblocker1 tsunami
unblock stuff with repl. GoGuardian has blocked repl
* word type prank
make everything your friend types say something else of your choice. temporary and site based. 
* yt add skipper
lets you skip a ad when YouTube gives you 2 30 second ads.
* yt comments
if your school blocked seeing the comment section on a video, this will let you see it.

## good job. you red all the bullet points and wasted your time.
